        Our innovative application is designed with compassion and the latest speech-recognition 
        technology to support individuals recovering from stroke or memory loss. By presenting 
        carefully selected images, the app gently prompts users to describe what they see, 
        encouraging verbal expression while providing immediate, constructive feedback on their 
        speech. This personalized approach not only aids in the restoration of communication 
        skills but also helps rebuild confidence and independence. Through a blend of clinical 
        insight and empathetic design, our solution strives to empower users on their journey 
        to reengage with the world around them.
